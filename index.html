											<h3 class="major">Dashboard Analysis</h3>
											<ul>
												<li>Total Customers: The number of total customers is increasing. In November there were 715,733
													customers and this number increased to 733,731 in December. This is an increase of around
													18,000 customers.</li>
												<li>Exit Customers: The number of exit customers is also increasing. There were 1,400 exit customers
													in November and 1,700 in December. This is an increase of around 300 customers.
													Customer Demographics: The majority of the exit customers are male (55.92%) and in the "fair"
													credit category (44.08%).</li>

								<h3>SMART AGRICULTURAL APPLICATION USING ML || AI,ML</h3>
								<h3></h3>

									<h3 class="major">Introduction</h3>
									<p>Traditional farming methods are undergoing a significant transformation with the integration of modern technology, giving rise to what is known as smart agriculture or precision agriculture. Smart agriculture leverages advanced technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), drones, and data analytics to optimize various aspects of farming operations.</p>
									
								
									<h3 class="major">OBJECTIVE OF THE PROJECT</h3>
									<ul>
									<li>Supply and demand is most important in agriculture economy.In order to get profit margin we need to
										handle it efficiently . Using historical and Seasonal Crop price by region based demand and supply for
										crop it will suggest crops based on soil nature which will be demand in next 6 to 9 months with a crop
										price so farmers can make profit by harvesting the profitable crop which is suitable for their soil.</li>

									<li>Food Traceability helps to track the food in the supply chain, which supports the accurate
									withdrawal/recall of unsafe food, if required. By this feature consumer can rate the farmer’s product by
									it’s quality.So good rated product can be sold more than other product. With help of QR, consumer’s get
									location of product and purchase in person.</li>

									<li>Lack of awareness in Government schemes among farmers make unable to utilize the offers provided by
									the government. using this Application farmers can know their government schemes to minimize the
									cost of subsidy, fertilizer and so on.</li>
									
									
									</ul>

									<h3 class="major">Proposed Methodology</h3>
									<ul>
									<li>This application is developed using flutter that suggest crops based on soil nature and crop demand with
										crop price based on the crop market , provides solutions for soil nutrient and decreased crop profitability.</li>
										
									<li>Based on historical and seasonal crop data, this application will suggest the price and demand for the crop
										before seeding time.</li>
										
									<li>This application will suggest crop based on the soil nature using sensors.</li>
										
									<li>In order to gather and process chemical data from the soil, optical and electrochemical types of sensors are
										employed since they are capable of detecting soil characteristics, humidity levels, and other environmental
										factors.</li>
										
									<li>The food traceability feature makes use of gps and farmer unique ID. In order to give quality of food direct
										from the farmers with rating feature.</li>
										
									<li>This application also includes government agricultural schemes that will be especially helpful to
										small-scale farmers.</li>
										
									<li>The combination of all these capabilities into a single application will assist farmers in solving their
										crop-related issues.</li>
										
									
								
									
									</ul>
										
									<h3 class="major">Conclusion</h3>
									<p>Smart agriculture represents a paradigm shift in the way farming is practiced, leveraging cutting-edge technologies to address the challenges of the modern agricultural industry. By harnessing the power of IoT, AI, drones, and data analytics, smart agriculture holds the potential to revolutionize food production, improve sustainability, and ensure food security for future generations.</p>

The final output of this project is a dashboard which provides a comprehensive overview of bike sales data, allowing stakeholders to analyse trends, identify patterns, and make informed decisions.</p>

										</ul>
										<li>Middle Age Group (31-54) shows the highest number of purchases. The management should ensure that it should target this segmen of population.</li>
										<li>An inverse linear relationship indicates that as the commuters' distance increases, they prefer other means of transportation other than bike riding so the company should focus on short distance commuters.</li>
